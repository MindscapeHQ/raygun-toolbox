```

### Usage

Call to `raygun-cli` with a command and arguments.

Or use directly from sources:

```

**Common mandatory arguments**

- `token` is an access token from https://app.raygun.com/user/tokens.

#### Sourcemap Uploader

```
raygun-cli sourcemap --input-map=path/to/map/index.js.map --uri=https://example.com/index.js --app-id=APP_ID --token=TOKEN

The command can be used to upload any single sourcemap.

##### Flutter Sourcemaps

To upload Flutter web sourcemaps to [raygun.com](https://raygun.com), navigate to your project root and run the `sourcemap` command and set the `platform` argument (or `-p`) to `flutter`.

The `input-map` argument is optional for Flutter web projects. 
`raygun-cli` will try to find the `main.dart.js.map` file in `build/web/main.dart.js.map` automatically.

```
raygun-cli sourcemap -p flutter --uri=https://example.com/main.dart.js --app-id=APP_ID --token=TOKEN

## Development

### Compiling a binary

Compile a self-contained exec:

```
dart compile exe bin/raygun_cli.dart -o raygun-cli
```

Note: The binary is compiled for the architecture and host system. To compile for macOS and Windows we must setup CI VMs. See: https://dart.dev/tools/dart-compile#known-limitations
